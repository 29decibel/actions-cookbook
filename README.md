# Welcome to Actions-Cookbook! ðŸŒŸ

## What's This All About?

The `actions-cookbook` is a unique collection of examples and templates, 
designed to showcase the possibilities with the [Robocorp Action Server](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp).

## Project Status: Developer Preview

It's important to note that the Robocorp Action Server itself is in an open-source developer preview phase.
This means while you explore and contribute to the `actions-cookbook`, you're also interacting with a platform
that's actively evolving. We're excited to see how your contributions will not only enrich the Cookbook
but also demonstrate the capabilities and potential of the Robocorp Action Server.

## Explore Our Examples

Currently, our repository features a shining example at 
[/examples/openai/local-advanced-data-analysis](/examples/openai/local-advanced-data-analysis) â€“ a testament to what can be achieved
with the right mix of Python, AI, and automation. This example serves as a blueprint,
guiding you on how to create and contribute your own AI actions.
Stay tuned, as we're eager to expand this section with more diverse
and groundbreaking examples, with your help!
